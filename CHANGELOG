# Changelog

- 0.2.0 (2025-02-18)
  * The base58check encode and decode functions no longer treat version
    bytes (of which there may now be several) in any special fashion.
    Version bytes should be prepended to the target string before
    encoding, and removed manually from any decoded strings.

- 0.1.1 (2025-01-06)
  * Includes a minor encoding-related performance optimisation.

- 0.1.0 (2024-12-18)
  * Initial release, supporting basic encoding/decoding.
